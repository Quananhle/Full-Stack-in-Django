# Full-Stack-in-Django-Framework

This repository contains code examples of various workstations and features which function similarly to the codes I developed and pushed to build a real-world cloud-based shop floor control (SFC) that is currently being deployed in assembly plants of a company in the top 5 world largest manufacturing companies by revenue. The shop floor management application is used to track the progress, test the products, and report the status of work of manufacturing plants, and is customized to the needs of client's projects (Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Seagate)
